This is the midterm project of Econometrics: Multiple Equation Estimation (PhD level course from Department of Agriculture & Resource Economics, UC Berkeley)
In this project I replicate a paper from Prof. Sofia Villas-Boas. The paper is trying to find the correlation between PM2.5 and fatal car accidences in California.
The project has two highlights:
First, I use matrix to calculate most of the coefficient instead of using the canned function in R directly. THis could display the whole process in a more mathematical way.
Second, I use two methods to solve the endogenent problem in dataset (2SLS and control function approach) and logit model in this project.
Plus, there is a numerical simulation at the end of the project, showing the asymptotic property of the estimated coefficient.
